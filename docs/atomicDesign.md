Reusability: Like atoms, molecules should be designed to be reusable in various parts of your application.

Encapsulation: Molecules can manage simple internal logic or state, but they should remain focused and easy to compose with other molecules and atoms.

Single Responsibility: Molecules should serve a single purpose and do it well. If a molecule becomes too complex, it may need to be broken down into smaller components or promoted to an Organism.
